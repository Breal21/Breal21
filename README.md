-Hi, Iâ€™m @Breal21 â€” an Ethical Hacker in the making, currently pursuing certifications to level up in the cybersecurity world.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a self-taught Python programmer with a passion for Robotics and hands-on tech tinkering. From building mechanical puppets to crafting tools like IP grabbers and website mappers, I love exploring the boundary between creativity and code.

ðŸ”§ I troubleshoot and configure networks, dabble in Android software, and never shy away from getting my hands dirty with systems that need a little extra love.
